# How to use

1. Clone the repository.

    _NOTE_: Currently the project has grown in size a bit (roughly 45MB) mainly due to .git folder size (this is probably because I had to upload different versions of a certain .gif file throughout time). To download the project with reduced .git folder size use: ```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/giorgi-m/online-shop.git```.  

2. ```cd``` into the project folder.
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm start```
